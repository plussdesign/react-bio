# react-bio
A Biological approach to building react applications by implementing an open component standard.

This is the Open Reference Implementation in Node.js and React.js using the principles of my paper on Biological Object Oriented Programming which can be found here: https://app.gitbook.com/@genlabss/s/bioop/

The GitBook is an open white paper explaining the conceptual ideas for applying biological principles and lessons to modern software engineering.

This repository contains the basic structure, architecture and setup for building React.js applications following the principles explained in the book.
This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC) but it can be used as a starting point for real projects used in production environments.  

All Technologies used in this project are open source.

- DGraph
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Next.js
- SocketCluster
- Redux 
- Redux Logic
- React.js
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion
