# react-bio
A Biological approach to building react applications by implementing an open component standard.

This is the Open Reference Implementation in Node.js and React.js using the principles of my GitBook on Biological Object Oriented Programming which can be found here: https://app.gitbook.com/@genlabss/s/bioop/

The GitBook is an open white paper explaining the conceptual ideas for applying biological principles and lessons to modern software engineering.

This repository contains the basic structure, architecture and setup for building React.js applications following the principles explained in the book.
This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC) and should be considered a lab project so feel free to change and adapt to your needs when used in a production environment.   

All Technologies used in this project are open source.

- DGraph
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Next.js
- SocketCluster
- Redux 
- Redux Logic
- React.js
- Styled Components
- Framer Motion
